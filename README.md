## Reader SDK requirements and limitations

* Reader SDK is only available for accounts based in the United States.
  Authorization requests for accounts based outside the United States return an
  error.
* Reader SDK may not be used for unattended terminals. Using Reader SDK to
  implement payment solutions in unattended terminals or kiosks (for example,
  vending machines) is strictly prohibited.
* Reader SDK requires an authorization token from the [Mobile Authorization API]
  to connect Square Readers and accept payments.
* Reader SDK only supports on-screen tipping. Digital receipts and tips can be
  configured in Reader SDK. Tipping on printed receipts is not supported at this
  time.
* Reader SDK cannot issue refunds. Refunds can be issued programmatically using
  the Transactions API or manually in the [Square Dashboard].
* Reader SDK is not supported in the Square sandbox. See [Testing Mobile Apps]
  for testing recommendations.
* Your version of Reader SDK must adhere to the Square SDK update policy. To
  limit risk to developers and their users, Square enforces an
  [update policy for Reader SDK] that requires developers to keep their version
  of Reader SDK current.
