## Method details

### authorizeAsync

location.

authCode  | string | Authorization code from the [Mobile Authorization API]

* **On success**: returns information about the currently authorized location as a
  [Location](#location) object.
* **On failure**: throws [`USAGE_ERROR`](#e1) or [`AUTHORIZE_NO_NETWORK`](#e2).

#### Example usage

```javascript
import {
  authorizeAsync,
  AuthorizeErrorNoNetowrk,
  UsageError,
} from 'react-native-square-reader-sdk';
...
try {
  const authorizedLocation = await authorizeAsync(authCode);
  // Authorized and authorizedLocation is available
} catch(ex) {
  switch(ex.code) {
    case AuthorizeErrorNoNetwork:
      // Remind connecting to network
      break;
    case UsageError:
      let errorMessage = ex.message;
      if (__DEV__) {

---

### Money

Captures information about the amount tendered during a transaction. **Monetary
amounts are specified, in the smallest denomination of the currency indicated**.
For example, when `currency` is `USD`, `amount` is in cents, so a 1 dollar
payment (1 USD) would have `amount` equal to `100`.  

Field        | Type    | Description
------------ | ------- | -----------------
amount       | integer | **REQUIRED** The amount of money, in the smallest denomination of the indicated currency.
currencyCode | string  | The type of currency, in [ISO 4217 format]. For example, the currency code for US dollars is USD.

All `Money` objects require an `amount` and `currencyCode` but `currenyCode` is
optional for the Reader SDK React Native plugin because `Money` objects will use
the currency code of the currently authorized location by default.

```json
{
  "amount": 100,
  "currencyCode": "USD"
}
```
